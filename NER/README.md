# NER Mountain recognition model



### Introduction

This project created as part of Quantum test task.
Main target of this test task - is create own named
entity recognition model and learn it to recognize
mountain entity in text/sentences.


## Details

For this task we need to create or find dataset with labeled mountains. Prepare it, clean from artifacts.
For creating model and model training we can use Spacy library (its specific library for NLP). Spacy use own format of data for training models. We need to create spacy's format for training, that we do in next step. When its done. we need to configure config file for training (it works from command line). When specialy spacy data for trainin is complete - next step - is training(we do it from command line too).
After that we can load our new model and use it for NER. You can check it and use if you need.


### How we built it:

- Numpy
- Pandas
- Tqdm
- Wikipedia-api
- Spacy
